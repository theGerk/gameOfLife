This is simple web application that runs a visual Game of Life simulation, information about which you can find here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life.

To run the program open the index.html file in any browser. (Only been tested in Chrome and Firefox, Firefox seems to run it most effectively). I would suggest starting out with maybe a cell size of 2 (pixels), and both width of height of 200-300 pixels.

Feel free to play with it, there are a while bunch of extra starting positions from the basic random if you poke around in the code a bit.
I plan to document these someday, but we'll see.
